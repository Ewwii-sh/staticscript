# Introduction

**Statictranspl** is a simple and static transpiler for ewwii. It is fast and is made for beginners who are unfamiliar with rhai syntax.

Statictranspl currently is very minimal and only supports basic transpilation of widgets only. Support for variables, functions, if/else, expressions, for/while, poll/listen etc. are still yet to be implmented.

One of the most useful features of statictranspl is its error handling. It is a better error handling than that of ewwii's, so some may find it easier to write configuration in statictranspl.
